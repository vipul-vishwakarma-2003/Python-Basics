        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in the 1980s. It is incredibly versatile, flexible, and beginner-friendly; hence is 2023's most popular programming language worldwide. Python is the most popular yet easiest programming language to learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - A python interpreter is a computer program that converts each high-level program statement into machine code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "    -  A Python keyword is a word that serves a specific function in Python. It is limited to one single function and it can not be set as a variable name, a function name, or the value of any other identifier. The purpose of the keyword is to define the syntax of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "    - we cannot use keywords as variable name because keywords already has there meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - mutability means we can make changes after it's get created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "    - Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified). We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - The '==' is known as the equality operator. The 'is' is known as the identity operator. The '==' operator helps us compare the equality of objects. The 'is' operator helps us check whether different variables point towards a similar object in the memory.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "   - In Python, logical operators carry out logical operations and return Boolean values based on the result. We need to verify multiple conditions simultaneously or use logical operators by combining multiple conditions in some cases. There are three types of logical operators in Python And, or & not operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - type casting converts the data type into another data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    - Implicit type conversion is performed by a Python interpreter only. Explicit type conversion is performed by the user by explicitly using type conversion functions in the program code.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - Conditional statements are an essential part of programming in Python. They allow you to make decisions based on the values of variables or the result of comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    - elif satement works when the if statement is false. if the 'if' statement is True then elif statement does not excutes, we can use elif statement multiple time.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    - Both for loop and while loop is used to execute the statements repeatedly while the program runs. The major difference between for loop and while loop is that for loop is used when the number of iterations is known, whereas execution is done in a while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    - If you want the loop to break based on a condition other than the number of times it runs, you should use a while loop.\n"
